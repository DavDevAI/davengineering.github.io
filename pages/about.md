Hello there, I'm David Alonso LopezRivas Jose and I am a Graduate Student of the Aeronautical University in Querétaro; passionate about Aeronautics, Science, Robotics and Technology, committed to the search for evolution through innovation and development through science as a tool for universal knowledge.  

Enthusiast of reading, self-learning, modern physics, electronics & computer systems, robotics, mechatronics, music, history. Creator of several independent projects oriented towards micro aeronautics and reversed engineered electronics, in relation to unmanned flight (electrical systems & propulsion, aerodynamics, power distribution and avionics/control); electronics/robotics, software development and fluid mechanics.

I have a solid background, related to Science and Technology, applied on Software (Embedded and Data Analysis for the Energy Industry) and Aerospace Industry, developing all my STEM skills to put it in action in the Industry Field. Here is a brief semblance of my academic and job experience so far: 

Graduate Student from the Aeronautical University in Querétaro, Aeroperformance Intern at GE Vernova, and former leader of Autopilot development in the DronKab team, as well as developer of both software and embedded software, possessing knowledge that interrelates among the aforementioned disciplines such as programming languages, Python, C++, robotic software development libraries running on Linux like PX4, ROS, Gazebo, SLAM, Ardupilot, Open CV, multiple Linux distributions, Virtual Machines, command line terminal, and bash scripting, development in microcontrollers like STM, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Texas Instruments (MSP & Hercules Launchpad), handling version control software Git & Github, knowledge in POWER ELECTRONICS, DIGITAL ELECTRONICS, ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS and high-frequency systems, protocols and networks (focused on the aerospace and energy sector), onboard integrated avionics (for both commercial aircraft and UAVs), in aspects of avionics for civil aircraft, knowledge in navigation, radionavigation, Avionic systems, troubleshooting, handling aeronautical technical manuals. Continuing in the field of UAVs, having developed multiple projects both personal and academic, such as 4 prototypes of multirotor drones, including a Quadrotor powered by an APM 2.8 and 4 high-torque motors for heavy-lifting, a prototype based on the DJI F450 platform to test the deployment of autonomous capabilities with a ground station using the APM 2.8 and Mission Planner, 1 FPV racing drone prototype powered by a Matek Systems F104 board, with Autopilot capabilities configured in Betaflight, designed for high speed, acrobatics, and FPV, and 1 remote-controlled flying wing with Autopilot and FPV integration capabilities. In addition to personal projects on the development of Autopilots, the development of 2 flight control boards and firmware, the first being entirely developed in Arduino and only with basic "3D" control and flight capabilities, and the second being a more sophisticated board incorporating an STM32 microcontroller, which is more compact and with which self-stabilization was achieved, incorporating a somewhat rudimentary control algorithm. For academic projects, we have the drones developed by the Kaan Drone team, which is also a prototype based on the DJI F450 platform, with the Autopilot Pixhawk 2.4.8, in order to conduct autonomy, telemetry, and ground station connection tests; which makes it smarter than its predecessors; as well as having the capability to integrate an onboard computer, either an NVIDIA Jetson Nano or a Raspberry Pi, for autonomous Autopilot; concluding with the Kaan Drone team having developed a heavy-lifting Hexa rotor drone based on the zd850 platform, which incorporates the same autonomy and telemetry capabilities as its aforementioned predecessor, but with the added benefit of being more robust, having longer flight time, and the ability to carry a payload of around 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms, onboard FPV camera, GPS, telemetry, and long range. Concluding the academic projects, I also participated in the theoretical development of a fixed-wing UAV to complete my social service, which was cut short by the pandemic, leaving it as a theoretical proposal that never made it off the blueprints. In this project, I was able to put all the knowledge acquired up to that point to the test, being the chief designer, having developed, along with a team, the aerodynamic design, surface parameterization, calculation and establishment of basic flight performance parameters, conceptual design, mechanical design, and design of some parts such as the wing, ailerons, airfoil profiles, as well as basic CFD of the airfoil profile and the primary wing assembly, as well as the design of the landing gear and its performance parameters.

Regarding MECHANICAL DESIGN, SPACE AND ROBOTICS: I also have knowledge of mechanical design with Solidworks software, having been certified in CSWA and completed the preparation course for CSWP, crucial knowledge that would be useful for applying in both the aeronautical and space sectors. So, by participating in the NASA Spaceapps CDMX edition, I was able to win at the local level, having developed a prototype to improve the assembly of orbital modules, based on piston and "Quick Release" mechanisms, accompanied by a robotic arm that would facilitate orbital coupling tasks, whose documentation can be found on the Challenge portal. Additionally, I created various prototypes in the 3D printing software, and in the field of space, I also completed the Space Mission Design and Operations course offered by EPFL on the eDX platform.

To conclude, it is also necessary to mention some personal projects such as a robotic arm and a line-following robot, in addition to having completed various courses related to machining, surface modeling in SolidWorks, an introductory course on Airbus A320 structures, participated in the USAC Mathematics Congress, and the Astronomy contest at the Monterrey Institute of Technology.
