IÂ´ve started a new Software & Web Development bootcamp, so to speak, I find interesting creting a blog/project portfolio site in which I am able to showcase my engineering projects, knowledge and background, just to feel as badass as Mark Zuckergberg with his [Zuckonit Blog](https://zuckonitt.livejournal.com/) Previously I've done some web development before, but I find it amusing taking it seriously, and thinking about taking the Electronics, Control and Software Specialization in my college.
