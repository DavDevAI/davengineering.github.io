These are my top 3 favorite books of this year. These year was a huge leap forward, and another check to my this year's objectives, and certainly I've encountered with these 3 MUST READ books, for everyoone who wants to change it's point of view and learn what the world and the Universe works, for some of you may seem straightforward, but for those who are willing to be someone in life, I think it's pretty cool!.

# Brave New World
I've encountered this brand-new sealed book on my sister's book table and never realized how good it was, it's dystopian, 
like 1984 dystopian..., and brings on the table what would happen if we could manufacture people on a great scale just like a ford!; I mean it thought-provoking and makes think about what would happen if we surpass that technology barrier and put ethics and morals aside and start manufacturing babies, also for me represents a thought experiment of what would happen if we bring capitalism to the extreme, so sure, it's a most read, just as 'Dune' from Herbert or '1984' from Orwell. 


## Rich Dad, Poor Dad
Probably one of the most eye-opener books I've encountered... I've found it in my grandpa's library and just beacuase I was starting a Investing Course I started to read it. The second I started, I didn't move until I finished it entirely, and this may seem as a 'red pill' clich√©, but it's a must and a starting point if you want to starting investing, taking care of your personal finance, start your own business and finally getting rich. This book also encouraged me to continue reading other finance and investment banking books such as 'The Intelligent Investor' from Benjamin Graham and so on.  



## The Secret

I'm just gonna say that it is also a must read, if you want a starting point on Spirituality and Esotheric content, that eventually would lead to paths such as occultism, but just as the last book mentioned, this is a good startin g point i nwhich you can famliarize with the Laws of the Universe, manifestation, and the way we see the body and soul, asside from any type of conventional religions.
