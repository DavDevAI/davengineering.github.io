Since the begining of this year, I came across a friend of mine's rocketry team, who decided to used a water propelled rocket, so he needed a Flight Computer developed from a prelimar prototpype using Arduino, the requirements needed were: 
-- Peak voltage (for AC, this is the amplitude of the voltage signal)
- Arduino/STM Microcontroller 
- MPU 6050 
- BMP 280
